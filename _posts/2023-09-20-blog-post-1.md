Juggling between applications like PowerPoint, Photoshop, Illustrator, and a command line interface or an IDE can indeed be challenging. I've discovered that working with a single window open significantly enhances my focus and efficiency in tackling one task at a time. While this might seem a bit at odds with the multitasking capabilities offered by contemporary graphical user interfaces, I've found it to be remarkably effective for boosting my productivity.

On that note, why not consider utilizing Python for all your plotting needs? Python is incredibly versatile and can often accomplish tasks quickly and efficiently. It could streamline your workflow and keep everything consolidated within a single, convenient interface. This approach not only simplifies the process but also leverages Python's powerful capabilities to your advantage.

Data description
