Juggling between applications like PowerPoint, Photoshop, Illustrator, and a command line interface or an IDE can indeed be challenging. I've discovered that working with a single window open significantly enhances my focus and efficiency in tackling one task at a time. While this might seem a bit at odds with the multitasking capabilities offered by contemporary graphical user interfaces, I've found it to be remarkably effective for boosting my productivity.

On that note, why not consider utilizing Python for all your plotting needs? Python is incredibly versatile and can often accomplish tasks quickly and efficiently. It could streamline your workflow and keep everything consolidated within a single, convenient interface. This approach not only simplifies the process but also leverages Python's powerful capabilities to your advantage.

Purpose
======

To enhance the clarity and precision of my simulation results, I found it essential to use a reference map, similar to an inset map, to accurately locate specific places. This is particularly important as the modeling domain slightly warps the real-world map due to its finite-difference discretization scheme. Having this reference is crucial for accurately tracking geomorphological and hydrological changes around key areas of interest, ensuring that my analysis is both detailed and contextually grounded in the real-world landscape.

When identifying places of interest, my initial approach involves a careful visual inspection, followed by a more detailed examination using graphics software like Photoshop. This software is particularly useful for manipulating and aligning real-world maps with surface elevation plots from the model results, ensuring that the locations match accurately. While this process can be quite time-consuming, it's a crucial step that needs to be completed before creating the figure below. This meticulous preparation helps in ensuring the highest accuracy and quality in our final presentation.

Data description
