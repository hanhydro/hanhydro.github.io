One significant critique of my dissertation centered on my writing style, which was described as overly florid and flamboyant. Specifically, it was pointed out that my use of synonyms was inaccurate, and the convoluted wording and descriptions did not align with the expected standards of scientific technical writing. Recognizing these issues, I aim to reevaluate the underlying problems and discuss strategies to prevent their recurrence in future work. Additionally, I will explore the influences that shaped my writing approach, particularly from the perspective of a non-native English speaker.
