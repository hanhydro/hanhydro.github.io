I aim to always be prepared for an impromptu field trip, regardless of its purpose, whether it's water quality monitoring, soil sampling, or groundwater pumping. I keep as much equipment as possible in my small vehicle, since I often donâ€™t know the exact nature of the task until the moment it arises, except in cases where the equipment is sensitive to thermal degradation or failure. I own a comprehensive suite of hydrologic instruments that allows me to conduct research in a variety of field conditions. While the initial investment was substantial, having my own equipment enables me to carry out research with little or no external funding.
