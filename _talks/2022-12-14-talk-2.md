While little is known about the relationship between the rate and timing of speciation, and changes in ecohydrological connectivity, we hypothesize that if there is a typical pattern observed in the relationship between drainage basin stream network changes and the evolutionary history of aquatic species over the long term, the cause and timing of speciation can be ascertained.
