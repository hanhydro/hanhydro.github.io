We develop a robust and simple rule-based algorithm to autonomously simulate alluvial fan deposition and evolution under continuously developing landscape conditions without prescribing deposition locations or imposing topographic constraints. Augmented with this algorithm, landscape evolution models are capable of dynamically detecting locations of potential fan deposition by statistical measures of surface topography and fluvial dynamics, then depositing fan sediments where and when the developed conditions require. To assess the method's efficacy in depositing sediment at a mountain-valley transition zone characterized by a transport surface that permits unobstructed exit of sediment and water, a hypothetical scenario is created that involves a frontal, normal fault. It is followed by a series of sensitivity analyses to ascertain the influence of parameters affecting fan deposition and secondary processes.
